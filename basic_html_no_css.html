    <head>

    </head>

<body>
<!-- The head of the document ends above. The head contains metadata about
     the document. Metadata includes the 'title' tag, which is used by search
     engines. The body, which always begins below the head, contains all the
     things that can be seen on the page. -->

<h1>This is an 'h1' heading</h1>

<p>An 'h1' heading should be used only for the most important heading in the document, which is usually the top heading.</p>

<h2>This is an 'h2' heading</h2>
<h3>This is an 'h3' heading</h3>
<h4>This is an 'h4' heading</h4>
<h5>This is an 'h5' heading</h5>
<h6>This is an 'h6' heading</h6>

<p>Headings indicate a hierarchy in your document. The 'h' tags should never be used in place of boldface or font-size. The appearance of headings can be changed with CSS.</p>

<h2>Images in HTML</h2>

<p>This image is in the same set of files as this document:</p>

<img src="images/kitten.jpg" alt="Photo of a kitten">

<p>This image is outside this set of files, on another web server:</p>

<img src="http://placekitten.com/400/400" alt="Photo of another kitten">

<p>The difference in the two images' locations can be found in the 'src' <strong>attribute,</strong> inside the 'img' tag.</p>

<h2>Links in HTML</h2>

<p>Links have something in common with images: you can write them to get a file from the same set of files as this document, or write them differently to get a file outside this set of files, on another web server.</p>

<p>This link opens a file from the same set of files as this document:
    <a href=""></a>. It uses what is called a <em>relative</em> URL.</p>

<p>This link opens a file from outside this set of files:
    <a href="http://placekitten.com/">The placekitten site</a>. It uses what is called an <em>absolute</em> URL.</p>

<p>The difference can be found in the 'href' <strong>attribute,</strong> inside the 'a' tag.</p>

<h2>HTML Lists</h2>

<!-- unordered list -->
<ul>
    <li>This is an unordered list.</li>
    <li>An unordered list has bullets (you can change that with CSS).</li>
    <li>You should learn the difference between an unordered list and an ordered list.</li>
</ul>

<!-- ordered list -->
<ol>
    <li>This is an ordered list.</li>
    <li>An ordered list has numbers (you can change that with CSS).</li>
    <li>You should learn the difference between an ordered list and an unordered list.</li>
</ol>

<!-- definition list -->
<dl>
    <dt>This is a definition list.</dt>
        <dd>Each item in a definition list has two parts, a term ('dt') and data ('dd'). Think of a dictionary definition: Word = term. Definition = data.</dd>
    <dt>Use CSS to change the appearance of a definition list.</dt>
        <dd>The structure of a definition list should indicate the pairs, term and data, but you can make them look however you like by changing their properties with CSS.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>After you have mastered the HTML tags and conventions on this page, you can start learning CSS.</p>

<!-- an HTML document will *always* end with the two tags below,
     in this order -->
